# Sensor fusion
A generic module for fusing the same information obtained from two sources. We assume that the information about the same variable from both sources forms a Gaussian.

This repository is a catkin ROS package. It consists of an example of fusing GPS (/gps1 and /gps2) and LIDAR (/velodyne_point) information.
